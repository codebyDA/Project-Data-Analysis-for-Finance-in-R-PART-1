### > A SIMPLE GUIDE STEP-BY-STEP DATASET PROCESSING (1) ──

#### →   Filtering the dataset, focused on the May 2020 time period

#### →   Create a summary per branch to see the best and worst five branches of data

#### →   As branches increase each month, it is necessary to check the age & performance each of it

#### →   Looking for the worst branches for each age group



### > IMPLEMENTATION R PACKAGES ──

#### ⋈ Package DPLYR ─ suitable for data manipulating & analytic

* `select()`    ⍽ variable selection

* `filter()`    ⍽ variable value filtration
						
* `mutate()`    ⍽ new variable creation based on the existed variable
						
* `summarise()` ⍽ variable value summarization
						
* `arrange()`   ⍽ variable arrangement based on it values

#### ⋈ Package GGPLOT2 ─ suitable for data visualization using plot function

            	⌐ syntax :> ggplot(data) + geom_type(aes(x,y,fill,color)) 

#### ⋈ Package SCALES ─ suitable for supporting the process of data exploration

* `comma()`   ⍽ variable format conversion (numerical format + separators)
